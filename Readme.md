You can use cost components for setting up rewards for your model as well. Feel free to play around with this script and make any edits / additions as required.

The SAC-based trading model was developed with a focus on minimizing transaction costs for selling shares of AAPL over a trading day. The architecture of the model is based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which is designed for continuous action spaces. SAC utilizes two main components: a policy network (actor), which predicts optimal actions such as the number of shares to sell based on the market state, and two Q-networks (critics), which estimate the expected rewards for taking specific actions. The model's objective was to minimize slippage, market impact, and opportunity costs through reinforcement learning. The state space included key market variables like the bid-ask spread, market volume, and momentum, while the action space allowed the model to select the number of shares to sell at each time step.

The model was fine-tuned using several strategies. A low learning rate of 0.0001 was chosen to ensure the model learned stably in this high-variance environment. The batch size was set to 512 to balance model convergence and computational efficiency, while the buffer size was increased to 500,000 to ensure sufficient historical market data was considered during training. The discount factor was set to 0.98, prioritizing near-term rewards, and a small tau value of 0.01 was used for smoother target network updates. The reward function was carefully defined to penalize slippage, market impact, and remaining shares at the end of the trading period to optimize for cost-efficient execution.

In back-testing, the modelâ€™s performance was compared against the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. The comparison focused on two key metrics: slippage, which is the difference between the execution price and the mid-price at the start of the trading session, and market impact, the cost of executing large trades that may move the price. The TWAP strategy showed total slippage of 1.821904e-13 and total market impact of 0.001257, while the VWAP strategy showed slippage of 2.635644e-18 and market impact of 0.000279. The SAC model achieved a balanced performance between the two benchmarks, dynamically adjusting to market conditions and minimizing transaction costs.

While the model development and fine-tuning were successfully completed, I encountered challenges in deploying the model on AWS SageMaker due to the lack of access to an active Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Specifically, SageMaker requires credentials and a valid account setup to utilize its services, including real-time inference endpoints, which I was unable to configure. Despite these limitations, the code for deploying the model and creating an API endpoint was written and tested locally. This included uploading the model to S3, configuring the SageMaker model, and setting up a real-time inference endpoint to accept trade data inputs, such as the number of shares to sell and the ticker symbol (AAPL).

Although I was unable to fully deploy the model on AWS SageMaker due to the lack of access to an active AWS account, I have prepared everything necessary for deployment and will still demonstrate the entire process in the video submission. The video will walk through the code I developed for uploading the trained model to S3, configuring the SageMaker model, and setting up a real-time inference endpoint. While the endpoint couldn't be tested live, I will show the steps involved, including how the API is designed to accept inputs like the ticker symbol (AAPL), the number of shares to sell, and the time horizon (defaulting to 390 minutes for a full trading day).

This demonstration will provide a comprehensive view of the model's architecture, the back-testing results, and the detailed AWS deployment process. Despite the lack of live execution on SageMaker, the video will showcase the setup and explain how the endpoint would return the optimized trading schedule in JSON format, including timestamps and share sizes. The entire deployment process has been prepared and is ready for execution once AWS access is granted.
