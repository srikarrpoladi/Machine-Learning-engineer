The SAC-based trading model was developed with a focus on minimizing transaction costs for selling shares of AAPL over a trading day. The architecture of the model is based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which is designed for continuous action spaces. SAC utilizes two main components: a policy network (actor), which predicts optimal actions such as the number of shares to sell based on the market state, and two Q-networks (critics), which estimate the expected rewards for taking specific actions. The model's objective was to minimize slippage, market impact, and opportunity costs through reinforcement learning. The state space included key market variables like the bid-ask spread, market volume, and momentum, while the action space allowed the model to select the number of shares to sell at each time step.
The model was fine-tuned using several strategies. A low learning rate of 0.0001 was chosen to ensure the model learned stably in this high-variance environment. The batch size was set to 512 to balance model convergence and computational efficiency, while the buffer size was increased to 500,000 to ensure sufficient historical market data was considered during training. The discount factor was set to 0.98, prioritizing near-term rewards, and a small tau value of 0.01 was used for smoother target network updates. The reward function was carefully defined to penalize slippage, market impact, and remaining shares at the end of the trading period to optimize for cost-efficient execution.
In back-testing, the modelâ€™s performance was compared against the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. The comparison focused on two key metrics: slippage, which is the difference between the execution price and the mid-price at the start of the trading session, and market impact, the cost of executing large trades that may move the price. The TWAP strategy showed total slippage of 1.821904e-13 and total market impact of 0.001257, while the VWAP strategy showed slippage of 2.635644e-18 and market impact of 0.000279. The SAC model achieved a balanced performance between the two benchmarks, dynamically adjusting to market conditions and minimizing transaction costs.
The final step involved deploying the fine-tuned model to AWS SageMaker as a real-time inference endpoint. The trained model was first saved and uploaded to an S3 bucket using boto3. It was then deployed on SageMaker using an ml.m5.large instance, creating an API endpoint that accepts input parameters such as the ticker (AAPL), the number of shares to sell, and the time horizon, which defaults to 390 minutes (one trading day). The API returns an optimized schedule in JSON format, detailing the timestamps and share sizes for each trade.
A video demonstration was created, showcasing the entire workflow from model testing and uploading to deployment on SageMaker and real-time inference. This project successfully demonstrated the design, tuning, back-testing, and deployment of the SAC model for minimizing transaction costs in algorithmic trading.
